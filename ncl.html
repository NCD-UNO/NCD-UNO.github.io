                In this paper, we address Novel Class Discovery (NCD), the task of unveiling new classes in a set of
                unlabeled samples given a labeled dataset with known classes. We exploit the peculiarities of NCD to
                build a new framework, named Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL), to learn discriminative
                representations that are important to clustering performance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we ﬁnd
                that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set generates representations in which a generic query
                sample and its neighbors are likely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and
                aggregate pseudo-positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the model to learn more
                discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most of the instances are easily discriminated by
                the network, contributing less to the contrastive loss. To overcome this issue, we propose to generate
                hard negatives by mixing labeled and unlabeled samples in the feature space. We experimentally
                demonstrate that these two ingredients signiﬁcantly contribute to clustering performance and lead our
                model to outperform state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., clustering accuracy +13% on
                CIFAR-100 and +8% on ImageNet).</p>

                The proposed neighborhood contrastive learning framework for novel class discovery. Given training
                images sampled from the labeled and the unlabeled data, we forward them into the network to obtain
                corresponding representations. For the labeled data, the CE loss, CS loss and the proposed NCL loss are
                calculated with the ground-truth labels. For the unlabeled data, BCE loss and CS loss are computed to
                optimize the new classiﬁer while the NCL loss is proposed to learn discriminative representation. CE:
                cross-entropy, BCE: binary cross-entropy, CS: consistency, NCL: neighborhood contrastive learning, HNG:
                hard negative generation.
